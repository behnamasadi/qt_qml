            Manual Positioning
            Positioning With Bindings
            Anchors
            anchor-based layouts are generally far more performant than
            binding-based if pristine. A "pristine" anchor layout is one which
            uses only anchors (with object nesting) to determine the
            positioning, whereas a "contaminated" anchor layout is one which
            uses both anchoring and bindings (either on position-related [x,y]
            properties or on dimension-related [width,height] properties) to
            determine the position.
