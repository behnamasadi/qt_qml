# QQmlEngine
`QQmlEngine` is a C++ class in the Qt framework that provides an environment for running QML applications. `QQmlEngine` is responsible for parsing QML code, instantiating QML objects, managing the object tree, and exposing C++ objects to the QML runtime.

`QQmlEngine` provides a number of features that make it easy to create sophisticated QML applications. For example, it includes a property system that allows QML objects to have properties that can be read and modified from both C++ and QML code. It also includes a signal-slot mechanism that allows QML objects to emit signals that can be connected to C++ functions, and vice versa.
